# AiBio-Final-Project
Final Project, choose own data, make a model


For the project, you can largely pick what you want to do. Essentially, select some data that can be analyzed with AI and work to make a notebook that walks through the process of analyzing the data.

## Data sources: 
Your own data

Kaggle

UCI Machine Learning Repository

NASA Earth Data

Google Dataset Search


## Make a notebook that has these sections:

Introduction: Describe the data and where you got the data. Describe the question being answered and the method(s) being used to answer the question.

Data pre-processing: What's needed to load the data, clean the data, normalize, etc.

Model setup: Setup one or more models

Hyperparameter tuning: Do some playing with the model hyperparameters (learning rate, optimizer, batch size, epochs, whatever makes sense)

Results: How did the model do

Discussion: Summarize what worked, what didn't etc.
