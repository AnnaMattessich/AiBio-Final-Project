# AiBio-Final-Project
Final Project, choose own data, make a model


For the project, you can largely pick what you want to do. Essentially, select some data that can be analyzed with AI and work to make a notebook that walks through the process of analyzing the data.

Data sources: 
Your own data
KaggleLinks to an external site.
UCI Machine Learning RepositoryLinks to an external site.
NASA Earth DataLinks to an external site.
Google Dataset SearchLinks to an external site.
Ask us! Matt and Arthur are happy to help find some data for you to work on!
Make a notebook that has these sections:

Introduction: Describe the data and where you got the data. Describe the question being answered and the method(s) being used to answer the question.
Data pre-processing: What's needed to load the data, clean the data, normalize, etc.
Model setup: Setup one or more models
Hyperparameter tuning: Do some playing with the model hyperparameters (learning rate, optimizer, batch size, epochs, whatever makes sense)
Results: How did the model do
Discussion: Summarize what worked, what didn't etc.
